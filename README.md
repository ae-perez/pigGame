A collaborative project with Professor Jonas Schmedtmann, from the Udemy course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!" 
Game covers things like:
- event listeners
- DOM changes 
- conditional statements like: if/else statements, for loops
- function calls
- methods that manipulate the data for the game to function correctly 


*Please note: there are a few bugs that need to be fixed but the appearance that go hand and hand with the functionality, work! :D
